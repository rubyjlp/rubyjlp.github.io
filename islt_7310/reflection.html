                <p><span style="color: red">I</span> make art about myself because I want people to understand me, and I
                    think, when I talk about myself, I do it all wrong. My art is about anxiety, about chronic illness,
                    about being weird and autistic and gay. It’s about loneliness, about craving, about being overrun
                    with a sense of dread, about my cat, and about the art I like. It’s silly, bright, warm, and
                    sometimes depraved. It feels like this big, glowing thing to me. Is that egotistical to say?</p>

                <p>I draw inspiration from Keith Haring, Jane Schoenbrun, Pauline Oliveros, Janelle Monae, Caroline
                    Polachek, 100 Gecs, the Strype Sisters, Basquiat, K-Ming Chang, Pamela Z, Chappell Roan, Caroline
                    Shaw, Meredith Monk, John Cage, Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, Pippa Garner, and my brilliant artist
                    friends, including (but not limited to) Murphy Severtson, Ava O’Dea, Eva Isherwood-Wallace, Lee
                    Harrison Daniel, and Peach Leach.</p>

                <p>This website marks an exploration into the question of whether my work is professionally viable. I
                    have big dreams and big projects in mind, and very little time to do them. I’m hoping that if I
                    start really intentionally investing time and energy into my practice, I’ll have some success with
                    this. Lots of people don’t, and it’d be conceited to say that I think I will, because so much of
                    success is dumb luck, but I feel like I need to give it a shot. </p>

                <p>Thanks for reading! I'm pretty new to all of this, and very open to any feedback.
                </p>
