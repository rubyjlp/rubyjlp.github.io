        <p>Hi! My name is Ruby Landau-Pincus. Iâ€™m a multidisciplinary artist, and this is my online portfolio. </p>
        <p>This website hosts the majority of my public facing art. On this website, you can get a sense of the types of work I do, my goals for future creative endeavors, and information on commissions and collaborations. I would like for this website to function as my primary internet presence for my art practice. Eventually, likely outside of the scope of this small project, I would like to make my creative coding projects more available online, and set up a way to sell prints and other merchandise featuring my art. Hosting this all on one website would be ideal, but may also be overkill. For now, I want to make sure that the website best captures the current state of my art practice, and links out to relevant projects where necessary. </p>
