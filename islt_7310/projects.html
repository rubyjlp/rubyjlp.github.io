            <p>Disillusioned by years of social rejection, a wannabe artist spurns the surface world to embark on
                her greatest project yet: a massive, sprawling, underground tunnel. As she digs deeper into her
                work, searching for self-actualization and clawing at any semblance of control, she finds herself
                buried in an all-too-familiar misery.

                <strong>Tunnel Play</strong> is a fifty-minute solo play about desperation. Critics have described
                Tunnel
                Play as
                “gunky, gross, and heartbreakingly, comically honest” (Ava O’Dea,<a
                    href="https://newplayexchange.org/plays/3318492/tunnel-play"> New Play Exchange</a>). It was first
                produced by the Spade Collective to a sold-out Brick Aux in 2024, directed by L.D. Kelley, managed
                by Kristina Fosmire, and starring Charlotte Teresa Guerrero. The script is available through <a

                <strong>Tunnel Play</strong> is my playwriting debut, and I’m very proud of it. It’s a great testament
                to my ability
                to work collaboratively with other artists. It also demonstrates my ability to work quickly —
                Charlotte and I wrote this play on a three week deadline while simultaneously very busy with other
                work. Most importantly, it’s shown me that my art can connect with a broad audience, and is
                potentially professionally viable.

            <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/popegonzo/?hl=en"><strong>Pope Gonzo</strong></a> is an Instagram
                project that is equal parts
                Muppet fan page and commentary on the Catholic Church, and an exercise in both photo editing and
                illustration. It answers the age old question “What if Gonzo was elected Pope?.” It shows Gonzo
                fulfilling papal duties, meeting with world leaders, kissing babies, and even receiving a custom
                vestment on his trip to Japan. <strong>Pope Gonzo</strong> has inspired fan art, and has raised money
                for protest bail
                funds through merchandise sales. The project began in 2019 and is ongoing, but is currently on an
                indefinite hiatus.
            </p>
            <p>

                <strong>Pope Gonzo</strong> is a great example of my skills in photo editing and digital art, as well as
                asset management
                (I maintain a collection of dozens of photos of Gonzo’s head at different angles). It also demonstrates
                my ability to create and adhere to a style guide. To remain consistent, I make sure that no other
                Muppets appear in “official” <strong>Pope Gonzo</strong> materials, that Gonzo is the same size as his
                human
                counterparts, and that assets are pulled from later Muppets materials, as the puppet’s design has
                changed over time. This project has also made me well-versed in working with print-on-demand merchandise
                companies.

            <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/clownpantscomics/?hl=en">The <strong>Skate</strong> comics</a> are a
                series I started in 2023 (https://www.instagram.com/clownpantscomics/?hl=en).
                They’re about a goofy beast named Skate, who loves to skate, and his weird stoner friends. The Skate
                comics are a sort of surrealist, zine-like project, featuring a range of media, from physical drawings,
                to digital collage, to animation. They’re silliness in its purest form. Themes of the
                <strong>Skate</strong> comics
                include wacky hijinks, taking it easy, having fun with friends, moving slowly, and not taking yourself
                too seriously. None of the animals in this series have ever experienced a deadline. The series is
                currently on hiatus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working on these comics has allowed me to loosen up in my art and to branch out into a range of styles.
                I’ve tried to make the characters have distinctive features, so they can shapeshift a bit without losing
                recognizability. Although I’ve been taking a break from the series, I have dozens of ideas for future
                <strong>Skate</strong> comics. It’s been wonderful to see how a small idea can give me so much
                inspiration.
